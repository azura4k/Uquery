                    <p>Uquery is a platform tool, in of which, users can sign in, deposit old or current usernames they
                        used to go by, and then wait as people search for them. The whole concept is for old friends to
                        be able to find you with ease. Me, a fellow gamer, has some old Xbox friends I wanna find one of
                        these days, so I made this platform free of charge for those in a similar boat as me. I custom
                        coded the backend as well.</p>
